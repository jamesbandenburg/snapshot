React app showing weather and travel information using various API calls.

v1.0.0: All basic functionality added. User can enter a city and see a weather forecast and a selection of places of interest. The background image will change to show the city the user has searched for. 

The app is responsive and will render correctly on desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices.

To improve:

Code is messy where individual weather forecast items are rendered. This can be refactored using a map method to render several individual components rather than one large one with chunks of repeated code.

Some visual optimisation to be made.

Some Bootstrap version conflicts to resolve.

Can the search be filtered to only accept cities? Currently, for example, one can search for 'puppies' and not retrieve any weather or travel information but the background image will change to some puppies!
